## Feedback & Iteration

**ClearFind** was tested with both technical and non-technical users:

* **Zoe (INFO 442 classmate):** Suggested lighter gradients, clearer icons, and examples in the Learn section.
* **Kristina (Chemistry major):** Emphasized clarity for beginners and the importance of labeling input expectations.

Their feedback led to UI refinements and improved user clarity.

---

## Known Issues

The deployed version currently experiences CORS and environment variable issues between **Render (backend)** and **Vercel (frontend)**.

All functionality works perfectly in local development.

If running locally, ensure:

* Both servers are active
* CORS is enabled in `server.js`
* `.env` file contains a valid MongoDB URI

---

## Future Plans

* Fix Render‚ÄìVercel deployment integration
* Add priority scoring for SEO/AEO issues
* Expand Learn section into interactive lessons
* Include AI-based recommendations for optimizing content
